Dispensary program
This program will be used by customers of a marijuana dispensary to aid both the customer and the workers of said dispensary, in completing the transaction. The customer will enter the type and quantity of product from a menu with various options. The total purchase amount will be displayed along with a measurement of the final amount of the product.  

As mentioned above, the purpose of this program will be to aid the workers in the number of orders placed by customers helping reduce the time of in person interactions between both parties. It will provide a clear and precise interface for the ordering of the product offered, with the end result being an order summary that is easy to read and understand for the workers of this establishment.  

This program will have several benefits for the business. Reducing the amount of man hours that are required to take a customerâ€™s order and minimizing the amount of errors that can occur when taking orders in a quick paced environment. The start up cost might be considered high but this program will pay for itself many times over within a short period of time. Aside from reducing man hours it will cut down on material usage, such as paper and pens/pencils. 

As far as the technical aspect of this program, it will be created in a way that will not be too difficult to maintain. Maintenance costs will be kept low by ensuring that this product is fully functional and free of any possible bugs or weak points. It will be written in Java, which is a widely known language that has a lot of resources and support when needed. This program will also be able to be updated as needed, whether technology requires it or business growth demands it. It is an overall well thought out and easy to use program that will serve its purpose.
